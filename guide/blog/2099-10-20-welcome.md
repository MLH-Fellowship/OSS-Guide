## Welcome to the Stories section of OSS-Guide

This space was formulated to enable -

* Fellow developers to share their experiences navigating any codebase, and
* Maintainers to share ways in which new contributors can begin exploring their open-source repos

To add a story, first fork and clone the [OSS Guide repository](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/OSS-Guide/). Then navigate to [`OSS-Guide/guide/blog/`](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/OSS-Guide/tree/main/guide/blog) and create a `markdown` file of the format - `YYYY-MM-DD-my-blog-post-title.md`. Insert your story inside the `.md` file, and send a Pull Request to the `main` branch of our repository.

Happy Exploring!
